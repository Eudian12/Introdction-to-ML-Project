# Introdction-to-ML-Project
This is a final project that I created with a fellow student for the course Introduction to Machine Learning.

The goal of this project was to classify about 60k files to malware and non malware using machine learning algorithms. 
We made explored and made changes to the data, removed outliers, normalized certain features and made transformations. 
We then tried several algorithms such as Naive Beyes, Multi-Layer Perceptron and ADABoost to try and predict whether files
in our validation sets (we used cross-validation) were malware, and eventually did it using a chosen algorithm on unknown data
and exploited the results to a csv file. 

The entire documentation of the project cant be found along the code on the Jupyter notebook, and an arranged summary of the project can
be found on the PDF file.
