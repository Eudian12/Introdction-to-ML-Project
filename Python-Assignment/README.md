This is the final assignment I had on my Python course in the university. 
This isn't a very complicated task, but I think it shows an understanding in Python and a neatly written code, so I added it to my portfolio. 
The task includes use of numpy to analyse different CSV files of COVID test results in different countries, and the creation of several graphs 
and a heatmap according to different inquiries.
